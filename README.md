**Complexes a protein is found in**

The proteins found in cellular complexes are available from the CORUM 5.0 database, https://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/corum/download
All annotated human protein complexes can be downloaded in *.txt format (tab separated). This python script identifies each protein in the downloaded file and finds all complexes it is used in. The output file consists of each protein followed by the complexes separated by a vertical line symbol.
To simplify matter, only the relevant columns are extracted from the rather daunting file downloaded.
